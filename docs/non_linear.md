# What are Non Linear Data Structures?

Non Linear data structure stores data in a **non-sequential** manner. It forms a **hierarchical relationship** among the child elements and parent elements. In other words, the data items are attached to each other creating a relationship between them.

It is not possible to insert elements, delete elements or go through the elements in sequential order. Usually, these data structures are more **memory efficient**.

[Trees](tree) and graphs are the most common nonlinear data structures.
